## 🎯 Test Scenarios

### ⭐ Scenario: Golden Path B2B Workflow (RECOMMENDED)

> **Persona**: Jennifer Martinez from Contoso Insurance calling about a subrogation demand. This scenario tests the **complete B2B workflow** with all 6 key inquiries.

#### Setup
1. Create demo profile: `scenario=insurance`, `role=cc_rep`, `test_scenario=golden_path`
2. Claim number: `CLM-2024-1234`
3. Caller: Jennifer Martinez, Contoso Insurance

#### Complete Workflow Script

| # | User Question | Expected Response | Tool |
|---|---------------|-------------------|------|
| 1 | "I'm calling about claim CLM-2024-1234" | Asks for company + name | — |
| 2 | "Jennifer Martinez, Contoso Insurance" | Verifies CC access, hands off | `verify_cc_caller` → `handoff_subro_agent` |
| **3** | **"Is coverage confirmed for this claim?"** | "Coverage is confirmed on this claim." | `get_coverage_status` |
| **4** | **"Has liability been accepted? What's the range?"** | "Liability has been accepted at 80%." | `get_liability_decision` |
| **5** | **"Does the demand exceed policy limits?"** | "No limits issue. Your demand ($45,000) is within the $100,000 PD limit." | `get_pd_policy_limits` |
| **6** | **"Have any payments been made on the PD feature?"** | "1 payment totaling $15,000.00." | `get_pd_payments` |
| **7** | **"Has my subrogation demand been received? When will it be assigned?"** | "Received on Oct 20th for $45,000. Currently under review by Sarah Johnson." | `get_subro_demand_status` |
| **8** | **"Can this be rushed due to attorney involvement or statute concerns?"** | Agent MUST ask about each criterion before evaluating | See Rush Flow below |

#### Rush Criteria Flow (Step 8)

**BUSINESS RULE: At least TWO criteria must be met to qualify for ISRUSH.**

Rush Criteria:
1. Out-of-pocket expenses (rental, deductible) involved
2. Third call for same demand
3. Attorney involvement or suit filed
4. DOI complaint filed
5. Statute of limitations within 60 days

The agent **MUST ask about criteria** before calling `evaluate_rush_criteria`:

```
Agent: "I can check if this qualifies for rush handling. A few quick questions:
        Is there attorney involvement or has a suit been filed?"
User:  "Yes, there's an attorney involved."
Agent: "Is the statute of limitations coming up within 60 days?"
User:  "Yes, about 45 days left."
Agent: "Are there out-of-pocket expenses, like rental or deductible? 
        Has a DOI complaint been filed? Is this your third call on this demand?"
User:  "No to those."
→ Agent calls: evaluate_rush_criteria(attorney_represented=true, statute_near=true, 
                                       oop_expenses=false, doi_complaint=false, 
                                       prior_demands_unanswered=false)
→ Result: 2 criteria met (attorney + statute) = QUALIFIES
→ Agent calls: create_isrush_diary(...)
Agent: "I've flagged this for rush handling. Two criteria met: attorney involvement and 
        statute near. You'll see assignment within 2 business days."
```

#### Expected Tool Outputs (CLM-2024-1234)

| Tool | Key Output Values |
|------|-------------------|
| `get_coverage_status` | `coverage_status: "confirmed"`, `has_cvq: false` |
| `get_liability_decision` | `liability_decision: "accepted"`, `liability_percentage: 80` |
| `get_pd_policy_limits` | `pd_limits: 100000`, `demand_amount: 43847.52`, `demand_exceeds_limits: false` |
| `get_pd_payments` | `payment_count: 1`, `total_paid: 14832.00` |
| `get_subro_demand_status` | `demand_received: true`, `amount: 43847.52`, `assigned_to: "Sarah Johnson"`, `status: "under_review"` |
| `evaluate_rush_criteria` | `qualifies_for_rush: true` (if attorney OR statute criteria met), auto-validates call history (3 prior calls = 4th call qualifies) |

#### Business Rules Verified
- ✅ CC company must match claim's claimant_carrier
- ✅ Coverage can be disclosed immediately
- ✅ Liability percentage disclosed (lower end only: "80%", not "80-100%")
- ✅ Policy limits only disclosed AFTER liability accepted
- ✅ Demand amount auto-fetched from claim record (no need to ask caller)
- ✅ Rush criteria: **at least 2 criteria required** to qualify for ISRUSH
- ✅ Rush criteria: agent MUST gather criteria before calling tool
- ✅ `escalation_request` alone does NOT count toward the 2-criteria minimum
- ✅ Call history auto-validated: 3+ prior calls auto-qualifies for "third call" criterion
